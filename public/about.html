<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I started my journey when I think for computer science engineering in 2020. From that I used to be in touch of latest technologies. As I was a studious boy I haven't focus on learning any languages in my 11th and 12th it is also a one of regrets of my life But its ok.I had learn about some basic java when I had Holidays after 12th and later in my college in 1st semester we had c programming so that's also been done.And Focusing on my present I am having this web development Course from last two weeks. I am very new to this stream let's see how it's work.
